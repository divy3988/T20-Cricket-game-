# T20-Cricket-game-
This project implements a T20 cricket game on a DE10 Lite FPGA board using Verilog. Key features include a pseudorandom number generator (LFSR) to simulate realistic cricket outcomes, user input through buttons, and a seven-segment LED display for scorekeeping. It covers button debouncing, clock management, and logic integration for digital design.
